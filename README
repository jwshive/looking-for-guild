Set it up so recruitment posts show like:
[US] [Alliance] [Stormrage] Guild_Name - Post Title.

Players should look the same
[US] [Alliance] [Stormrage] Player Name - if recruitment_post, Post Title., else nothing

Change the Character and Guild update pages to have a more pretty url like with character and guild details.
override the get_object method for updateview

Try to use bootstrap modals for the "Add or Update my Characters" link

Each of these, region, faction, server are searchable.
